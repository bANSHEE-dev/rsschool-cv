## Andrey Sankovich.
1. My goal is to enter "IT" as a Frontend-developer. **I like it.**
2. HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Also I work whith SCSS, SASS, Gulp.
3. [Github](https://github.com/banshee-dev).
4. Unfortunately, I donâ€™t have such an experience yet.
5. Self-education (codeacademy, htmlacademy, youtube channels), **RS School**.
6. Pre-Intermediate (*practice in video games, and very seldom on the work*).

One of the most my favorite *Kata* it's [6kyu **N-th Fibonacci**](https://www.codewars.com/kata/522551eee9abb932420004a0). 
The solution of which looks like this:
```
function nthFibo(n) {
  let fib = [0, 1];
  for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    fib.push(fib[i] + fib[i + 1]);
  }
  return fib[n - 1];
}

```
